# 1.Introduction
This report analyzes rainfall prediction using Linear Regression in R.

# 2.Data overview.
head (data)

# 3.Model building.
model<-lm(rain~tem,data=data)
summary(model)

# 4. Prediction.
data$predict_rain<-predict(model,data)
head(data)

# 5.Model evaluation.
library(Metrics)
rmse(data$rain, data$predict_rain)

#Conclusion.
The model shows the relationship between rainfall and temperature.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
